Why Factset?

I am very interested in applying the various tools and techniques that I've learned from machine learning and data analysis to processing financial data.  Factset is a company that provides financial data and services to investment professionals. Working in such an environment would not only provide me with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with manipulating and extracting valuable information from the data, but also gives me the right amount of exposure to the financial world.  
Therefore, companies like Factset and Bloomberg are on my list.  

These companies have the most valuable information in the financial world and they are vital part of this entire industry.  I want to be part of this.
